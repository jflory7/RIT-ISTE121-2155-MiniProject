# RIT-ISTE121-2155-MiniProject

**Othello** Mini Project by Justin W. Flory and Timothy Endersby for RIT ISTE-121, 2155.


## What

This repository contains our own implementation of the **Othello** board game. Othello is a classic board game where players battle to finish the game with more of their own pieces on the board than their opponent. The game is finished when there are no spaces left on the board or there are no more possible legal moves for either competitor.


## For what

This program was created for the ISTE-121 course taught by Prof. Michael Floeser at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/) in Spring 2016. The project was due on March 14th, 2016.


## Running

### Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, *nix systems

Run the following command in a terminal to build and run the Othello game.

```
$ javac *.java && java Othello
```
